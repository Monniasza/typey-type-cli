Barking
dogs
seldom
bite.
Beauty
lies
in
the
eyes
of
the
beholder.
Beauty
is
only
skin
deep.
Beggars
can't
be
choosers.
Better
late
than
never.
Better
safe
than
sorry.
Better
the
devil
you
know
than
the
devil
that
you
don't
know.
Birds
of
a
feather
flock
together.
Bitter
pills
may
have
blessed
effects.
Blood
is
thicker
than
water.
Blood
will
out.
Brain
is
better
than
brawn.
Bread
is
the
staff
of
life.
Butter
is
gold
in
the
morning,
silver
at
noon,
lead
at
night.
