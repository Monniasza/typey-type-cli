Talk
is
cheap.
Talk
of
the
devil
-
and
the
devil
appears.
The
best
things
in
life
are
free.
The
coat
makes
the
man.
The
cure
is
worse
than
the
disease.
The
early
bird
gets
the
worm.
The
end
justifies
the
means.
The
first
step
to
health
is
to
know
that
we
are
sick.
The
grass
is
always
greener
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence.
The
head
and
feet
keep
warm,
the
rest
will
take
no
harm.
The
more
things
change,
the
more
they
stay
the
same.
The
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword.
The
pot
calling
the
kettle
black.
The
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating.
There
are
too
many
chiefs
and
not
enough
Indians.
There's
always
a
calm
before
a
storm.
There's
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel.
There's
many
a
slip
'twixt
the
cup
and
the
lip.
There's
no
accounting
for
taste.
There's
no
time
like
the
present.
There's
plenty
more
fish
in
the
sea.
The
road
to
hell
is
paved
with
good
intentions.
The
spirit
is
willing
but
the
flesh
is
weak.
The
squeaky
wheel
gets
the
grease.
The
wish
is
father
to
the
thought.
Think
before
you
speak.
Those
who
live
in
glass
houses
shouldn't
throw
stones.
Time
flies.
Time
is
money.
To
err
is
human;
to
forgive,
divine.
Tomorrow
is
another
day.
Too
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth.
Truth
is
stranger
than
fiction.
Two
heads
are
better
than
one.
Two's
company,
three's
a
crowd.
Two
things
prolong
your
life:
A
quiet
heart
and
a
loving
wife.
