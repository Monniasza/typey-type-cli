Nature
abhors
a
vacuum.
Nature,
time,
and
patience
are
three
great
physicians.
Necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention.
Never
put
off
till
tomorrow
what
you
can
do
today.
New
brooms
sweep
clear.
No
cows,
no
cares.
No
gain
without
pain.
No
man
can
serve
two
masters.
No
news
is
good
news.
No
pain,
no
gain.
No
time
to
waste
like
the
present.
Nothing
ventured,
nothing
gained.
Nothing
succeeds
like
success.
