Half
a
loaf
is
better
than
none.
Haste
makes
waste.
Health
is
better
than
wealth.
Help
a
lame
dog
over
a
stile.
He
that
lives
too
fast,
goes
to
his
grave
too
soon.
He
that
will
steal
an
egg
will
steal
an
ox.
He
who
hesitates
is
lost.
He
who
laughs
last
laughs
best.
He
who
laughs
last
laughs
longest.
He
who
lives
by
the
sword
shall
die
by
the
sword.
He
who
sleeps
forgets
his
hunger.
Hindsight
is
20/20.
History
repeats
itself.
Home
is
where
the
heart
is.
Home
is
where
you
hang
your
hat.
Honesty
is
the
best
policy.
Hunger
is
the
best
spice.
