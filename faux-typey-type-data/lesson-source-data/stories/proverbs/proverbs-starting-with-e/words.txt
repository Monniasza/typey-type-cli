Early
bird
gets
the
worm.
Early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
makes
a
man
healthy,
wealthy,
and
wise.
Eat
to
live,
don't
live
to
eat.
Eat
when
you're
hungry,
and
drink
when
you're
dry.
East
or
West,
home
is
best.
Empty
barrels
make
the
most
sound.
Even
a
worm
will
turn.
Every
cloud
has
a
silver
lining.
Every
disease
will
have
its
course.
Every
dog
has
its
day.
Every
man
has
a
price.
Every
rule
has
an
exception.
Everything
comes
to
him
who
waits.
Every
why
has
a
wherefore.
