Laughter
is
the
best
medicine.
Learn
to
walk
before
you
run.
Let
sleeping
dogs
lie.
Lie
down
with
dogs,
wake
up
with
fleas.
Like
cures
like.
Little
enemies
and
little
wounds
must
not
be
despised.
Long
absent,
soon
forgotten.
Long
ways,
long
lies.
Look
after
the
pennies
and
the
pounds
will
look
after
themselves.
Look
before
you
leap.
Love
is
blind.
Let
the
cobbler
make
the
shoes.
