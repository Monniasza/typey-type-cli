Waste
not,
want
not.
We
all
make
mistakes.
We
must
take
the
bad
with
the
good.
What
goes
around,
comes
around.
What's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
When
in
Rome
do
as
the
Romans
do.
When
the
cat's
away
the
mice
will
play.
When
the
going
gets
tough,
the
tough
get
going.
When
you're
up
to
your
neck
in
alligators,
it
can
be
difficult
to
remember
that
the
original
goal
was
to
drain
the
swamp.
Where
one
door
shuts,
another
opens.
Where
there's
a
will
there's
a
way.
While
there's
life,
there's
hope.
Who
keeps
company
with
the
wolves,
will
learn
to
howl.
Wide
ears
and
short
tongue
are
the
best.
Wilful
waste
makes
woeful
want.
Without
sleep,
no
health.
