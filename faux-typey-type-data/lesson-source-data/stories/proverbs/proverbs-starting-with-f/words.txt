Faith
will
move
mountains.
Familiarity
breeds
contempt.
Fine
feathers
make
fine
birds.
Fine
words
butter
no
parsnips.
First
come,
first
served.
Fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread.
Forbidden
fruit
is
the
sweetest.
Forewarned
is
forearmed.
Fresh
pork
and
new
wine
kill
a
man
before
his
time.
Fretting
cares
make
grey
hairs.
Friend
to
all
is
a
friend
to
none.
