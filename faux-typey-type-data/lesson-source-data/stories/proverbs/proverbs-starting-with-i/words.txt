If
at
first
you
don't
succeed,
try,
try,
try
again.
If
a
thing
is
worth
doing,
it's
worth
doing
well.
If
mama
ain't
happy,
ain't
nobody
happy.
If
the
cap
fits,
wear
it.
If
the
shoe
fits,
wear
it.
If
wishes
were
horses,
beggars
would
ride.
If
you
are
going
to
eat
with
the
Devil,
bring
a
long
spoon.
If
you
buy
cheaply,
you
pay
dearly.
If
you
can't
beat
them,
join
them.
If
you
can't
be
good,
be
careful.
If
you
can't
take
the
heat,
get
out
of
the
kitchen.
If
you
keep
your
mouth
shut,
you
won't
put
your
foot
in
it.
If
you
want
a
thing
done
well,
do
it
yourself.
In
the
land
of
the
blind,
the
one-eyed
man
is
king.
It's
a
good
horse
that
never
stumbles.
It
never
rains,
but
it
pours.
It's
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning.
It's
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
good.
It's
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
one
good.
It's
better
to
give
than
to
receive.
It's
better
to
have
loved
and
lost
than
never
to
have
loved
at
all.
It's
better
to
have
loved
and
lost
than
to
have
shot
and
missed.
It's
darkest
before
dawn.
It's
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event.
It's
never
too
late
to
mend.
It's
not
over
till
it's
over.
It's
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk.
It's
the
early
bird
that
gets
the
worm.
It's
the
empty
can
that
makes
the
most
noise.
It's
the
squeaky
wheel
that
gets
the
grease.
It
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world.
It
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel.
It
takes
two
to
tango.
