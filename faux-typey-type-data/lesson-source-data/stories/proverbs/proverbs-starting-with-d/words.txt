diseases
must
have
desperate
cures.
Desperate
diseases
must
have
desperate
remedies.
Desperate
times
call
for
desperate
measures.
Different
sores
must
have
different
salves.
Diseases
come
on
horseback,
but
steal
away
on
foot.
Do
as
you
would
be
done
by.
Do
unto
others
as
you
would
have
done
to
you.
Doctors
make
the
worst
patients.
Don't
burn
your

burn
your
bridges
behind
you.

change
horses
in
midstream.
Don't
count
your
chickens
before
they're
hatched.
Don't
cross
a
bridge
until
you
come
to
it.
Don't
cry
over
spilt
milk.
Don't
cut
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
face.
Don't
have
too
many
irons
in
the
fire.
Don't
make
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill.
Don't
put
all
your
eggs
in
one
basket.
Don't
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
Don't
put
off
until
tomorrow
what
you
can
do
today.
Don't
shut
the
barn
door
after
the
horse
is
gone.
Don't
shut
the
gate
after
the
horse
has
bolted.
Don't
spit
into
the
wind.
Don't
throw
out
the
baby
with
the
bathwater.
Doubt
is
the
beginning,
not
the
end,
of
wisdom.
