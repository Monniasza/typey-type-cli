Give
a
dog
a
bad
name
and
hang
him.
Give
a
man
a
fish
and
you
feed
him
for
a
day;
teach
a
man
to
fish
and
you
feed
him
for
a
lifetime.
Give
the
devil
his
due.
God
cures
and
the
physician
takes
the
fee.
Good
eating
deserves
good
drinking.
Good
fences
make
good
neighbors.
Great
minds
think
alike,
but
fools
seldom
differ.
