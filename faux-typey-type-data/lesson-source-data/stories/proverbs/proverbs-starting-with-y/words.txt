You
can
lead
a
horse
to
water
but
you
can't
make
it
drink.
You
can't
have
it
both
ways.
You
can't
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too.
You
can't
make
an
omelette
without
breaking
eggs.
You
can't
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow's
ear.
You
can't
make
chicken
soup
out
of
chicken
poop.
You
can't
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds.
You
can't
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks.
You
can't
tell
a
book
by
its
cover.
You
have
to
be
cruel
to
be
kind.
You
have
to
crawl
before
you
can
walk.
You
have
to
walk
before
you
can
run.
You
never
know
what
you've
got
till
it's
gone.
You
scratch
my
back
and
I'll
scratch
yours.
