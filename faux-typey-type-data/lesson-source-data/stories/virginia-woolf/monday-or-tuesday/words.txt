Lazy
and
indifferent,
shaking
space
easily
from
his
wings,
knowing
his
way,
the
heron
passes
over
the
church
beneath
the
sky.
White
and
distant,
absorbed
in
itself,
endlessly
the
sky
covers
and
uncovers,
moves
and
remains.
A
lake?
Blot
the
shores
of
it
out!
A
mountain?
Oh,
perfect—the
sun
gold
on
its
slopes.
Down
that
falls.
Ferns
then,
or
white
feathers,
for
ever
and
ever——
Desiring
truth,
awaiting
it,
laboriously
distilling
a
few
words,
for
ever
desiring—(a
cry
starts
to
the
left,
another
to
the
right.
Wheels
strike
divergently.
Omnibuses
conglomerate
in
conflict)—for
ever
desiring—(the
clock
asseverates
with
twelve
distinct
strokes
that
it
is
midday;
light
sheds
gold
scales;
children
swarm)—for
ever
desiring
truth.
Red
is
the
dome;
coins
hang
on
the
trees;
smoke
trails
from
the
chimneys;
bark,
shout,
cry
"Iron
for
sale"—and
truth?
Radiating
to
a
point
men's
feet
and
women's
feet,
black
or
gold-encrusted—(This
foggy
weather—Sugar?
No,
thank
you—The
commonwealth
of
the
future)—the
firelight
darting
and
making
the
room
red,
save
for
the
black
figures
and
their
bright
eyes,
while
outside
a
van
discharges,
Miss
Thingummy
drinks
tea
at
her
desk,
and
plate-glass
preserves
fur
coats——
Flaunted,
leaf-light,
drifting
at
corners,
blown
across
the
wheels,
silver-splashed,
home
or
not
home,
gathered,
scattered,
squandered
in
separate
scales,
swept
up,
down,
torn,
sunk,
assembled—and
truth?
Now
to
recollect
by
the
fireside
on
the
white
square
of
marble.
From
ivory
depths
words
rising
shed
their
blackness,
blossom
and
penetrate.
Fallen
the
book;
in
the
flame,
in
the
smoke,
in
the
momentary
sparks—or
now
voyaging,
the
marble
square
pendant,
minarets
beneath
and
the
Indian
seas,
while
space
rushes
blue
and
stars
glint—truth?
or
now,
content
with
closeness?
Lazy
and
indifferent
the
heron
returns;
the
sky
veils
her
stars;
then
bares
them.
