Green.
The
pointed
fingers
of
glass
hang
downwards.
The
light
slides
down
the
glass,
and
drops
a
pool
of
green.
All
day
long
the
ten
fingers
of
the
lustre
drop
green
upon
the
marble.
The
feathers
of
parakeets—
their
harsh
cries—
sharp
blades
of
palm
trees—
green,
too;
green
needles
glittering
in
the
sun.
But
the
hard
glass
drips
on
to
the
marble;
the
pools
hover
above
the
dessert
sand;
the
camels
lurch
through
them;
the
pools
settle
on
the
marble;
rushes
edge
them;
weeds
clog
them;
here
and
there
a
white
blossom;
the
frog
flops
over;
at
night
the
stars
are
set
there
unbroken.
Evening
comes,
and
the
shadow
sweeps
the
green
over
the
mantelpiece;
the
ruffled
surface
of
ocean.
No
ships
come;
the
aimless
waves
sway
beneath
the
empty
sky.
It's
night;
the
needles
drip
blots
of
blue.
The
green's
out.
Blue.
The
snub-nosed
monster
rises
to
the
surface
and
spouts
through
his
blunt
nostrils
two
columns
of
water,
which,
fiery-white
in
the
centre,
spray
off
into
a
fringe
of
blue
beads.
Strokes
of
blue
line
the
black
tarpaulin
of
his
hide.
Slushing
the
water
through
mouth
and
nostrils
he
sings,
heavy
with
water,
and
the
blue
closes
over
him
dowsing
the
polished
pebbles
of
his
eyes.
Thrown
upon
the
beach
he
lies,
blunt,
obtuse,
shedding
dry
blue
scales.
Their
metallic
blue
stains
the
rusty
iron
on
the
beach.
Blue
are
the
ribs
of
the
wrecked
rowing
boat.
A
wave
rolls
beneath
the
blue
bells.
But
the
cathedral's
different,
cold,
incense
laden,
faint
blue
with
the
veils
of
madonnas.
