You
are
never
too
old
to
learn.
You
are
what
you
eat.
You
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing.
You
can
lead
a
horse
to
water,
but
you
cannot
make
it
drink.
You
can
never
tell.
You
cannot
always
get
what
you
want.
You
cannot
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too.
You
cannot
get
blood
out
of
a
stone.
You
cannot
make
a
silk
purse
from
a
sow's
ear.
You
cannot
make
an
omelette
without
breaking
eggs.
You
cannot
make
bricks
without
straw.
You
cannot
push
a
rope.
You
cannot
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds.
You
cannot
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks.
You
cannot
win
them
all.
You
catch
more
flies
with
honey
than
with
vinegar.
You
pay
your
money
and
you
take
your
choice.
Youth
is
wasted
on
the
young.
You
may
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
for
a
lamb.
You
must
have
rocks
in
your
head.
You
scratch
my
back
and
I
will
scratch
yours.
You've
got
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff.
You've
made
your
bed
and
you
must
lie
in
it.
