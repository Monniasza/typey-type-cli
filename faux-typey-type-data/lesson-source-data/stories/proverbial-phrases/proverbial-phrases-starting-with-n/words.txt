Nature
abhors
a
vacuum.
Necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention.
Needs
must
when
the
devil
drives.
Never
cast
a
clout
until
May
be
out.
Never
give
advice
unless
asked.
Never
give
a
sucker
an
even
break.
Never
judge
a
book
by
its
cover.
Never
let
the
sun
go
down
on
your
anger.
Never
let
the
truth
get
in
the
way
of
a
good
story.
Never
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth.
Never
put
off
until
tomorrow
what
you
can
do
today.
Never
reveal
a
man's
wage,
and
woman's
age.
Never
speak
ill
of
the
dead.
Never
say
die.
Never
say
never.
Never
tell
tales
out
of
school.
Never
too
old
to
learn.
Nine
tailors
make
a
man.
No
guts,
no
glory.
No
man
can
serve
two
masters.
No
man
is
an
island.
No
names,
no
pack-drill.
No
news
is
good
news.
No
one
can
make
you
feel
inferior
without
your
consent.
No
pain,
no
gain.
No
rest
for
the
wicked.
Not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost.
Nothing
is
certain
but
death
and
taxes.
Nothing
succeeds
like
success.
Nothing
ventured,
nothing
gained.
