Early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
makes
a
man
healthy,
wealthy
and
wise.
Easier
said
than
done.
East
is
east,
and
west
is
west
and
never
the
twain
shall
meet.
East,
west,
home
is
best.
Easy
come,
easy
go.
Early
marriage,
earlier
pregnant.
Eat
breakfast
like
a
king,
lunch
like
a
prince
and
dinner
like
a
pauper.
Eat,
drink
and
be
merry,
for
tomorrow
we
die.
Empty
vessels
make
the
most
noise.
Enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast.
Even
a
worm
will
turn.
Even
from
a
foe
a
man
may
learn
wisdom.
Every
cloud
has
a
silver
lining.
Every
dog
has
his
day.
Every
Jack
has
his
Jill.
Every
little
bit
helps.
Every
man
for
himself,
and
the
Devil
take
the
hindmost.
Every
man
has
his
price.
Every
picture
tells
a
story.
Every
stick
has
two
ends.
Everybody
wants
to
go
to
heaven
but
nobody
wants
to
die.
Everyone
has
their
price.
Everything
comes
to
those
who
wait.
Every
tide
has
its
ebb.
