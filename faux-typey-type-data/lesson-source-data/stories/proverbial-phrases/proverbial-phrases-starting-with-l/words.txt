Laugh
before
breakfast,
cry
before
supper.
Laugh
and
the
world
laughs
with
you,
weep
and
you
weep
alone.
Laughter
is
the
best
medicine.
Late
lunch
makes
day
go
faster.
Learn
a
language,
and
you
will
avoid
a
war.
Least
said,
soonest
mended.
Less
is
more.
Let
bygones
be
bygones.
Let
not
the
sun
go
down
on
your
wrath.
Let
sleeping
dogs
lie.
Let
the
buyer
beware.
Let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
Let
the
dead
bury
the
dead.
Let
the
punishment
fit
the
crime.
Let
well
alone.
Let
your
hair
down.
Life
begins
at
forty.
Life
is
too
short
not
to
do
something
that
matters.
Life
is
not
all
beer
and
skittles.
Life
is
what
you
make
it.
Lightning
never
strikes
twice
in
the
same
place.
Like
father,
like
son.
Little
pitchers
have
big
ears.
Little
strokes
fell
great
oaks.
Little
things
please
little
minds.
Live
and
let
live.
Live
for
today,
for
tomorrow
never
comes.
Live
to
fight
another
day.
Loose
lips
sink
ships.
Look
before
you
leap.
Love
is
blind.
Love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil.
Love
makes
the
world
go
around.
Love
will
find
a
way.
