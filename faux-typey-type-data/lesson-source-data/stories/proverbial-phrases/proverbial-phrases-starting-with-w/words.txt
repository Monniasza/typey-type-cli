Walk
softly
but
carry
a
big
stick.
Walls
have
ears.
Walnuts
and
pears
you
plant
for
your
heirs.
Waste
not,
want
not.
Well
begun
is
half
done.
Well
done
is
better
than
well
said.
What
cannot
be
cured
must
be
endured.
What
goes
around,
comes
around.
What
goes
up
must
come
down.
What
you
lose
on
the
swings
you
gain
on
the
roundabouts.
What
is
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
What
the
eye
does
not
see
the
heart
does
not
grieve
over.
When
in
Rome,
do
as
the
Romans
do.
Whatever
floats
your
boat.
When
it
rains
it
pours.
When
life
gives
you
lemons,
make
lemonade.
When
the
cat
is
away,
the
mice
will
play.
When
the
going
gets
tough,
the
tough
get
going.
When
the
oak
is
before
the
ash,
then
you
will
only
get
a
splash;
when
the
ash
is
before
the
oak,
then
you
may
expect
a
soak.
When
three
women
gather,
it
becomes
noisy.
When
you
have
seen
one,
you
have
seen
them
all.
What
is
learnt
in
the
cradle
lasts
to
the
tombs.
What
the
eye
does
not
see,
the
heart
does
not
grieve
over.
Where
there
is
a
will
there
is
a
way.
Where
there
is
muck
there
is
brass.
Where
there
is
life
there
is
hope.
Whether
you
think
you
can,
or
you
think
you
can't,
you're
right.
While
there
is
life
there
is
hope.
Who
will
bell
the
cat?
Whom
the
Gods
love
die
young.
Why
keep
a
dog
and
bark
yourself?
With
great
responsibility
comes
great
power.
Woman
is
the
root
of
both
good
and
evil.
Wonders
will
never
cease.
Work
expands
so
as
to
fill
the
time
available.
Worrying
never
did
anyone
any
good.
