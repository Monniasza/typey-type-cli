Half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread.
Handsome
is
as
handsome
does.
Hard
cases
make
bad
law.
Hard
work
never
did
anyone
any
harm.
Haste
makes
waste.
He
that
goes
a-borrowing,
goes
a-sorrowing.
He
who
can,
does;
he
who
cannot,
teaches.
He
who
hesitates
is
lost.
He
who
laughs
last
laughs
longest.
He
who
lives
by
the
sword,
dies
by
the
sword.
He
who
loves
the
world
as
his
body
may
be
entrusted
with
the
empire.
He
who
makes
a
beast
out
of
himself
gets
rid
of
the
pain
of
being
a
man.
He
who
pays
the
piper
calls
the
tune.
He
who
knows
does
not
speak.
He
who
sups
with
the
Devil
should
have
a
long
spoon.
Hell
hath
no
fury
like
a
woman
scorned.
Heav'n
has
no
Rage,
like
Love
to
Hatred
turn'd,
Nor
Hell
a
Fury,
like
a
Woman
scorn'd.
Hindsight
is
always
twenty-twenty.
History
repeats
itself.
Home
is
where
the
heart
is.
Honesty
is
the
best
policy.
Hope
for
the
best,
and
prepare
for
the
worst.
Hope
springs
eternal.
Horses
for
courses.
Hunger
never
knows
the
taste,
sleep
never
knows
the
comfort.
History
repeats
itself,
and
it
does
not
care
what
it
repeats.
