See
a
penny
and
pick
it
up,
all
the
day
you
will
have
good
luck;
see
a
penny
and
let
it
lay,
bad
luck
you
will
have
all
day.
See
no
evil,
hear
no
evil,
speak
no
evil.
Seeing
is
believing.
Seek
and
ye
shall
find.
Set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief.
Shiny
are
the
distant
hills.
Shrouds
have
no
pockets.
Speech
is
silver
but
Silence
is
golden.
Slow
and
steady
wins
the
race.
Slow
but
sure.
Softly,
softly,
catchee
monkey.
Some
are
more
equal
than
others.
Sometimes
we
are
the
student.
Spare
the
rod
and
spoil
the
child.
Speak
as
you
find.
Speak
softly
and
carry
a
big
stick.
Sticks
and
stones
may
break
my
bones,
but
words
will
never
hurt
me.
Still
waters
run
deep.
Strike
while
the
iron
is
hot.
Stupid
is
as
stupid
does.
Success
has
many
fathers,
while
failure
is
an
orphan.
Speak
of
the
devil
and
he
shall
sure
appear.
A
swarm
in
May
is
worth
a
load
of
hay;
a
swarm
in
June
is
worth
a
silver
spoon;
but
a
swarm
in
July
is
not
worth
a
fly.
