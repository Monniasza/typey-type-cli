ages and generations
aid and comfort
alas and alack
bits and pieces
body and soul
born and raised
bright and early
brick and mortar
by hook or by crook
cheek by jowl
clean and tidy
chapter and verse
this day and age
dollars and cents
dot the i's and cross the t's
fear and loathing
first and foremost
hail and farewell
hand over fist
haughty and high minded
head and shoulders
heart and soul
herbs and spices
house and home
hunger and thirst
leaps and bounds
like father, like son
like mother, like daughter
lo and behold
neat and tidy
six of one,
half a dozen of the other
nickel and dime
nook and cranny
null and void
over and done with
pain and suffering
peace and quiet
pick and choose
on pins and needles
plain and simple
prim and proper
rant and rave
rocks and shoals
shock and awe
signs and wonders
skull and bones
skull and crossbones
strait and narrow
stress and strain
ticks and chiggers
whine and complain
wind and rain
yea and amen
